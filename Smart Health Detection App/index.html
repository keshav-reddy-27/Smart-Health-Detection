    <p>The age of digital technology requires the world to provide the
        best possible health care system, to ensure that citizens and
        communities are alive and well. This study suggests the use of
        a mining health data mining algorithm that could ultimately
        establish an appropriate patient health prediction system.
        Although, health care is available to everyone in the world,
        there is still no system of health care that is completely reliable
        and accurate to diagnose a patient carefully in his or her
        current health issues. Although some hospitals are wellequipped to provide the best possible healthcare for their
        citizens, some hospitals are still lacking in quality. Therefore,
        patients are sceptical and uncertain when it comes to choosing
        which hospital is best for them. Ultimately, these problems
        undermine the ability of hospitals to manage their
        management and operations more effectively in order to
        maintain the health of all citizens and communities. Patients
        need accurate and accurate treatment and diagnosis in order
        to recover and for their proper health and medical staff need
        to be well equipped with their clinical knowledge and
        communication skills to carefully evaluate their patients to
        ensure good health. Therefore, the use of data mining in health
        forecasts is considered in this paper as the best way to help a
        better health care system.</p>
        <p>People's health is one of the most important factors
            contributing to economic development in any economy. The
            most important and immediate consequences of a global
            decline take the form of damage to human health.
            This process has gained tremendous importance in the
            medical field. It is estimated that a care hospital can
            produce five terabytes of data per year.
            Therefore, in order to overcome the problems that people
            have with their health problems, we have developed an easyto-use app that helps users get tested at their place of
            residence at any time.
            The application also offers the option to book an
            appointment with a doctor to discuss health-related issues
            and get a thorough diagnosis</p>
